Did you know, without the ego, there is no narative
It's dark, but just a game
It's all just scared of dying, but isn't this a beach?
I heard you guys are very safe, caught up with the featherweights
Between life and death, there is you
Happy birthday Johnny, wherever you are
Everybody Lost Somebody
